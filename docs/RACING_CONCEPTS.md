## Safety Car / Yellow Flag Basics

### What is a Safety Car?

A **safety car** (also called **pace car** in oval racing) is a vehicle that enters the track during dangerous conditions to:
- Slow down the race
- Bunch up the field
- Allow track marshals to safely clear incidents or debris
- Neutralize racing competition temporarily

### Yellow Flag

When a safety car is deployed, **yellow flags** are shown to indicate:
- **No passing allowed** (with rare exceptions)
- **Slow down** to safety car speed
- **Caution period** is active

### Why Deploy a Safety Car?

Common reasons for safety car deployment:
1. **Stopped cars on track** - Vehicles that have crashed or broken down
2. **Cars off track** - Vehicles that have spun or left the racing surface
3. **Debris on track** - Parts, fluids, or other hazards
4. **Weather conditions** - Rain, fog, or other dangerous conditions
5. **Multiple incidents** - Several cars involved in crashes

### Safety Car Procedure

**Typical sequence:**
1. **Yellow flag thrown** - Racing neutralized, no passing
2. **Field bunches up** - Cars catch up to pace car
3. **Wave arounds** - Lapped cars allowed to regain a lap (see below)
4. **Pace laps** - Field circulates behind pace car for set number of laps
5. **Green flag** - Racing resumes

## Wave Arounds / Lucky Dog

### What is a Wave Around?

A **wave around** (also called **lucky dog** or **free pass**) is when lapped cars are allowed to pass the pace car and lead lap cars to **regain a lost lap**.

### Why Wave Arounds?

**Purpose:**
- Reduces likelihood of lapped cars interfering with lead lap battles
- Makes restarts safer by grouping similar-speed cars
- Rewards cars that were unlucky but still running

### When Are Wave Arounds Given?

**Timing:**
- After the field has bunched up behind the pace car
- Before the pace laps countdown begins
- Typically 1-2 laps into the yellow flag period

### Wave Around Strategies

This application implements **three strategies** for determining which cars get waved around:

#### 1. WAVE_LAPPED_CARS (Traditional Strategy)

**Who gets waved:**
- Cars that are **2 or more laps down** (clearly lapped)
- Cars that are **1 lap down AND behind their class leader**

**Logic:**
```
IF laps_behind >= 2:
    WAVE CAR
ELSE IF laps_behind == 1 AND position < class_leader_position:
    WAVE CAR
```

**Example:**
- Car #42 is 2 laps down → Gets waved
- Car #7 is 1 lap down but ahead of class leader → Does NOT get waved
- Car #99 is 1 lap down and behind class leader → Gets waved

#### 2. WAVE_AHEAD_OF_CLASS_LEAD (Road Course Strategy)

**Who gets waved:**
- Cars that are **ahead of their class leader** in running order
- But **behind the overall race leader**

**Logic:**
```
IF position_from_safety_car < class_leader_position_from_safety_car:
    WAVE CAR
```

**Purpose:** Handles situations in multi-class racing where faster class leaders may have lapped slower class cars.

#### 3. WAVE_COMBINED (Union Strategy)

**Who gets waved:**
- Any car that qualifies under **either Strategy 1 OR Strategy 2**

**Logic:**
```
IF qualifies_for_lapped_wave OR qualifies_for_ahead_of_class_wave:
    WAVE CAR
```

**Purpose:** Most comprehensive approach, ensures maximum fairness across all classes.

### Wave Around Command Execution

**Order matters:**
- Commands are sent in **running order behind the safety car**
- Closest car to pace car is waved first
- 0.5 second delay between commands to avoid rate limiting

**Why order matters:**
- Cars closer to pace car reach the wave-around point sooner
- Ensures smooth execution without traffic jams
- Mimics real-world race control procedures

## Lap Counting and Position Calculation

### Key Metrics

#### Laps Completed
- **Definition:** Number of full laps crossed at the start/finish line
- **Type:** Integer (0, 1, 2, ...)
- **SDK Field:** `CarIdxLap`

#### Laps Started
- **Definition:** The lap currently in progress
- **Type:** Integer
- **Relationship:** `laps_started = laps_completed + 1` (when on track)

#### Lap Distance
- **Definition:** Progress through the current lap
- **Type:** Float (0.0 to 1.0)
- **SDK Field:** `CarIdxLapDistPct`
- **Examples:**
  - `0.0` = At start/finish line
  - `0.5` = Halfway around the lap
  - `0.99` = Almost at start/finish line

#### Total Distance
- **Definition:** Complete measure of position accounting for fractional laps
- **Type:** Float
- **Calculation:** `total_distance = laps_completed + lap_distance`
- **Examples:**
  - `10.0` = Completed 10 laps, at start/finish
  - `10.5` = Completed 10 laps, halfway through lap 11
  - `10.75` = Completed 10 laps, 75% through lap 11

### Position Calculation

**Running order** is determined by `total_distance`:

```python
# Sort drivers by total_distance (descending)
sorted_drivers = sorted(drivers, key=lambda d: d["total_distance"], reverse=True)

# Driver with highest total_distance is in P1 (position 1)
# Driver with lowest total_distance is last
```

**Example:**
```
Car #1: total_distance = 15.8  → Position 1 (leader)
Car #2: total_distance = 15.6  → Position 2
Car #3: total_distance = 14.9  → Position 3 (1 lap down)
Car #4: total_distance = 13.2  → Position 4 (2 laps down)
```

### Lapped Cars

A car is **lapped** when its `laps_completed` is less than the leader's:

```python
laps_behind = leader_laps_completed - car_laps_completed

if laps_behind >= 1:
    # Car is lapped
```

**Note:** A car can be physically ahead of the leader on track but still be lapped (completed fewer full laps).

### Stopped Car Detection

A car is **stopped** if its `total_distance` hasn't changed between frames:

```python
# Previous frame
previous_total_distance = 10.5

# Current frame
current_total_distance = 10.5  # Same!

# Car hasn't moved → stopped
```

**Why this works:** Even at 1 mph, a car will show measurable `lap_distance` change over 1 second.

## Multi-Class Racing

### What is Multi-Class Racing?

**Definition:** Multiple vehicle classes compete in the same race simultaneously.

**Example classes in iRacing:**
- **GT3** - Fast, modern GT cars
- **GT4** - Slower, production-based GT cars
- **LMP2** - Fast prototype sports cars
- **GTE** - Professional-spec GT cars

**Key characteristic:** Different classes have different performance levels and race for separate class championships.

### Class Leaders

Each class has its own **class leader** (car with most laps completed in that class):

```python
# Find class leader for class_id=2
class_2_drivers = [d for d in drivers if d["car_class_id"] == 2]
class_leader = max(class_2_drivers, key=lambda d: d["total_distance"])
```

### Why Multi-Class Matters for Wave Arounds

**Problem:** A fast class (e.g., LMP2) may lap a slower class (e.g., GT4) multiple times.

**Solution:** Wave around strategies consider **class-relative positions**:
- GT4 car 1 lap behind GT4 class leader → May get waved
- GT4 car 1 lap behind overall leader (LMP2) → Different rules apply

**Strategy 2 (WAVE_AHEAD_OF_CLASS_LEAD)** specifically handles this:
- GT4 car ahead of GT4 class leader but behind overall leader → Gets waved
- Prevents slower class leaders from being stuck behind their own lapped cars

## Track Locations and Surfaces

### TrkLoc (Track Location)

The iRacing SDK provides a `TrkLoc` enum indicating where a car is:

#### Primary Values

**TrkLoc.not_in_world** (`-1`)
- Car not loaded or not on track
- Filters out: spectators, disconnected drivers

**TrkLoc.off_track** (`0`)
- Car has left the racing surface
- Detection criteria for off-track incidents

**TrkLoc.in_pit_stall** (`1`)
- Car is stopped in their pit box
- Servicing (tires, fuel, repairs)

**TrkLoc.approaching_pits** (`2`)
- Car on pit entry road
- Heading to pit stall

**TrkLoc.on_track** (`3`)
- Car on the racing surface
- Normal racing conditions

### Why Track Location Matters

**Detection filtering:**
```python
# Don't count cars in pits as "stopped"
if driver["track_loc"] in [TrkLoc.in_pit_stall, TrkLoc.approaching_pits]:
    continue  # Skip this driver

# Don't count cars that aren't loaded
if driver["track_loc"] == TrkLoc.not_in_world:
    continue  # Skip this driver

# Only detect off-track cars
if driver["track_loc"] == TrkLoc.off_track:
    off_track_drivers.append(driver)
```

### on_pit_road Flag

Additional boolean flag indicating pit road status:

```python
if driver["on_pit_road"]:
    # Car is on pit entry or pit exit road
    # May still be in TrkLoc.on_track but should be filtered
```

**Combined checking:**
```python
# Comprehensive pit filtering
if driver["on_pit_road"] or driver["track_loc"] in [TrkLoc.in_pit_stall, TrkLoc.approaching_pits]:
    # Car is in pit complex, skip from detection
```

## iRacing-Specific Terminology

### Pace Car vs Safety Car

- **Pace Car:** iRacing's term for the AI-controlled safety car
- **Safety Car:** General racing term (same thing)
- **Code:** Often uses "pace car" to match iRacing terminology

### Chat Commands

iRacing accepts race control commands via the chat interface:

#### `!y <message>` - Throw Yellow Flag
```
!y Debris on track
!y Multiple cars involved
```
- Deploys full-course yellow
- Message appears to all drivers
- Pace car enters track

#### `!p <laps>` - Set Pace Laps
```
!p 2    # 2 more pace laps until green
!p 1    # 1 more pace lap until green
```
- Countdown displayed to drivers
- Pace car will exit after specified laps

#### `!w <car_number>` - Wave Around
```
!w 42   # Wave car #42
!w 7    # Wave car #7
```
- Allows specified car to pass pace car
- Car regains one lap

#### Command Timing
- **0.1s delay** after opening chat (UI update time)
- **0.5s delay** between commands (rate limiting)
- **Window focus required** (pywinauto limitation)

### Sessions

iRacing has different session types:

- **PRACTICE** - Non-competitive practice session
- **QUALIFY** - Qualifying for starting position
- **WARMUP** - Pre-race warm-up session
- **RACE** - Actual race session

**Application behavior:**
- Only monitors during **RACE** sessions
- Skips PRACTICE, QUALIFY, WARMUP
- Waits for green flag in RACE before monitoring

### SDK Data Structure

#### CarIdx (Car Index)
- **Definition:** Array index for a car (0-63)
- **Fixed:** Same car keeps same CarIdx throughout session
- **NOT position:** CarIdx=0 is not necessarily the leader

#### Array Access Pattern
```python
# All driver data is in parallel arrays indexed by CarIdx
laps = ir["CarIdxLap"]              # Array of laps per car
distances = ir["CarIdxLapDistPct"]  # Array of lap distances per car

# Access specific car's data
car_1_laps = laps[1]       # CarIdx=1's laps
car_1_distance = distances[1]  # CarIdx=1's lap distance
```

#### Driver Info Dictionary
```python
# Driver metadata (car number, class, etc.)
driver_info = ir["DriverInfo"]["Drivers"]  # List of driver dicts

# Find driver by CarIdx
for driver in driver_info:
    if driver["CarIdx"] == 5:
        car_number = driver["CarNumber"]
        is_pace_car = driver["CarIsPaceCar"]
```

### SDK Quirks

#### Negative Lap Distance
- **Issue:** SDK occasionally returns negative `CarIdxLapDistPct`
- **Cause:** Unknown (SDK glitch?)
- **Solution:** Filter out: `if lap_distance < 0: continue`

#### Lag Detection
- **Issue:** During SDK lag, all cars may appear stopped
- **Cause:** Data not updating during connection issues
- **Solution:** If >X cars stopped, assume lag and ignore

#### Pace Car in Arrays
- **Issue:** Pace car included in all driver arrays
- **Flag:** `CarIsPaceCar == 1` (true)
- **Solution:** Filter out: `if driver["is_pace_car"]: continue`

## Racing Rules Summary

For quick reference:

**Yellow Flag Rules:**
- No passing (except wave arounds)
- Slow to pace car speed
- Bunch up behind pace car

**Wave Around Rules:**
- Given to lapped cars during yellow
- Pass pace car to regain one lap
- Sent in running order (closest to pace car first)

**Lap Counting:**
- Laps completed = full laps crossed at S/F
- Lap distance = fraction of current lap (0.0-1.0)
- Total distance = laps_completed + lap_distance

**Multi-Class:**
- Multiple classes race simultaneously
- Each class has own leader
- Wave arounds consider class-relative positions
