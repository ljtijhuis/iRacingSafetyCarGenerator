"""End-to-end tests using NDJSON dump replay.

These tests replay real SDK recordings through the detection pipeline to validate
safety car triggering, wave around logic, and threshold behavior. They serve as
both regression tests and a template for writing new scenario tests.

GETTING STARTED — How to write a new e2e test:

1. Pick a dump file from docs/dumps/ (or record a new one in dev mode).

2. Create settings with make_settings(), overriding only what you need:
       settings = make_settings(
           stopped_cars_threshold=2,       # How many stopped cars trigger SC
           off_track_cars_threshold=3,      # How many off-track cars trigger SC
           stopped_detector_enabled=True,   # Enable/disable stopped detector
           off_track_detector_enabled=True, # Enable/disable off-track detector
           random_detector_enabled=False,   # Random SC (usually off for deterministic tests)
           proximity_filter_enabled=False,  # Proximity-based clustering
           proximity_filter_distance_percentage=0.05,
           event_time_window_seconds=5.0,   # Sliding window for threshold checking
           race_start_threshold_multiplier=1.0,  # 1.0 = no multiplier
           race_start_threshold_multiplier_time_seconds=0.0,
           detection_start_minute=0.0,      # Earliest SC possible (minutes)
           detection_end_minute=60.0,       # Latest SC possible (minutes)
           max_safety_cars=10,              # Max SCs per race
           wave_arounds_enabled=True,       # Whether to send wave arounds
           laps_before_wave_arounds=1,      # Laps after SC before waving
           wave_around_rules_index=0,       # 0=lapped, 1=ahead of lead, 2=combined
       )

3. Create a DumpReplayer and run:
       replayer = DumpReplayer(dump_path, settings=settings)
       result = replayer.run()

4. Assert on the result:
       result.total_safety_cars()           → int: number of SCs triggered
       result.safety_car_events[n]          → SafetyCarEvent with frame_index, wave_commands
       result.waved_car_numbers_for_sc(n)   → list[str]: car numbers waved at SC n
       result.sc_triggered_at_frame(idx)    → bool: was SC triggered at this frame?
       result.detection_log                 → list[DetectionLogEntry]: per-frame details

   DetectionLogEntry has:
       .frame_index, .timestamp
       .stopped_drivers   → list[int] of driver_idx values detected as stopped
       .off_track_drivers → list[int] of driver_idx values detected as off-track
       .threshold_met     → bool: was threshold met at this frame?

For wave around testing with realistic lap timing:
       replayer = DumpReplayer(
           dump_path,
           settings=settings,
           compute_waves_after_laps=1,  # Compute waves 1 lap after SC
       )

    Bug 1 — Double-counting in accumulative threshold (fixed in ec3dfc2):
        The old code summed weights for ALL event types per driver. A driver
        both stopped (weight=3) and off-track (weight=2) contributed 5 to the
        accumulative score. With 2 drivers: 2×5 = 10 >= 7 threshold → SC.
        The fix takes only the highest weight per driver: 2×max(3,2) = 6 < 7 → no SC.

    Bug 2 — Waving not-in-world cars (fixed in 597efb5):
        11 cars with track_loc=-1 (disconnected/not_in_world) had laps_started=-1,
        appearing "many laps behind" the class leader. They were incorrectly waved.
        The fix filters TrkLoc.not_in_world from wave around eligibility.
